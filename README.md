## ✨ Featured Project

### 🎤 Speech Recognition GUI Calculator

One of my proudest achievements is creating a Python-based calculator with a graphical user interface (GUI) and integrated speech recognition.

---

## 🧩 About the Code

This calculator project blends traditional GUI elements with modern speech recognition:

- **Graphical User Interface:** Built using Tkinter for an intuitive and interactive experience.
- **Speech Input:** Uses the `speech_recognition` library to let users perform calculations by speaking (e.g., “two plus two”).
- **Smart Parsing:** Recognizes common math keywords like “plus,” “minus,” “times,” and converts them into mathematical symbols.
- **Features:**  
  - Calculation history  
  - Error handling and user feedback  
  - Support for square roots, brackets, and more  
  - Backspace, clear, and speech input buttons
  - (This code is similar to my previous code, but it has a new speech recognition feature)

> **Why it stands out:**  
> This project challenged me to blend core programming logic with user-friendly design and real-world functionality. It’s a big step in my journey as a developer!
